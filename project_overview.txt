# 🌿 EcoRoute Optimizer - Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Concept
EcoRoute Optimizer is a real-time route optimization system designed to minimize carbon emissions and maximize fuel efficiency. It calculates the most eco-friendly route between two points by considering distance, elevation gain, and traffic conditions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.9+ using **FastAPI** for high-performance asynchronous API endpoints.
- **Frontend**: Single-page application using **HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript**.
- **Mapping & Visualization**: 
    - **Leaflet.js**: For interactive map rendering.
    - **OpenStreetMap**: For map tiles.
    - **Nominatim API**: For geocoding (converting addresses to coordinates).
    - **OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine)**: For calculating actual road routes.
- **Voice AI**: **Web Speech API** for hands-free voice feedback and alerts.
- **Deployment**: Dockerized environment with automated start scripts.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Component Interaction
1. **Frontend (`frontend.html`)**:
   - Provides a search interface with autocomplete for origin and destination.
   - Communicates with the Nominatim API for location data.
   - Sends route requests to the FastAPI backend.
   - Displays the route on an interactive Leaflet map using OSRM data.
   - Provides voice feedback for metrics and driving tips.

2. **Backend (`main.py`)**:
   - Exposes RESTful endpoints (`/calculate-route`, `/compare-routes`, `/recalculate`).
   - Implements the **Fuel Efficiency Model**.
   - Handles route logic and coordinates distance calculations using the Haversine formula (as a fallback).
   - Simulates traffic conditions and suggests efficiency tips.

## 🧮 Fuel Efficiency Model
The system uses a mathematical model to estimate fuel consumption:
- **Base Consumption**: 0.08 liters per kilometer (standard vehicle average).
- **Elevation Penalty**: Fuel consumption increases by 15% for every 100 meters of elevation gain.
- **Traffic Multipliers**:
    - **Normal**: 1.0x
    - **Moderate**: 1.25x
    - **Heavy**: 1.6x
- **CO2 Calculation**: 2.31 kg of CO2 is emitted per liter of fuel consumed.
- **Cost Estimation**: Fixed at $1.50 per liter.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Real-time Rerouting**: The frontend periodically simulates traffic changes. If heavy traffic is detected, it automatically calls the `/recalculate` endpoint to find a more efficient path.
- **Voice Feedback**: Spoken updates on distance, fuel savings, and carbon footprint.
- **Interactive Map**: Custom markers, animated route lines, and auto-zooming.
- **Smart Driving Tips**: Context-aware recommendations (e.g., "Avoid rapid acceleration") to further reduce fuel usage.

## 📁 File Structure
- `main.py`: The heart of the backend logic and API.
- `frontend.html`: The entire user interface and client-side logic.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`).
- `Dockerfile` & `start.sh`: Setup and execution environment.
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation.

## 🚀 How to use this context
When working with this project, focus on enhancing the **Fuel Efficiency Model**, integrating **real-world elevation/traffic APIs**, or expanding the **Voice AI** capabilities. The frontend and backend are decoupled, communicating via JSON over HTTP.
